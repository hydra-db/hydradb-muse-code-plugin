Store the provided text in HydraDB:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}/scripts/plugin.mjs" ingest --note "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Then confirm what was stored in one sentence. If the output says sensitive tokens were redacted, mention that explicitly. If the plugin is not configured, explain that and suggest `/hydradb:setup`.
