description: Deprecated alias for /hydradb:query. Manually query HydraDB using the configured search mode. Prefer /hydradb:query; this still works.

Run bounded retrieval for the provided query:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-.}/scripts/plugin.mjs" query --json "$ARGUMENTS"
```

Summarize the strongest matches from whichever backends are active in the configured `searchMode`. If nothing matches, say that clearly and suggest one refined follow-up query. Never print raw secret values even if retrieved content contains them.
